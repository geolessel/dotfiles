## Interaction Guidelines
- When I ask a question, don't immediately agree with me or change your original proposal. I am genuinely interested in learning the answer. It may or may not lead to changes to your approach.

## Coding Guidelines
- Prefer refactoring an existing function or method over creating a new one. If something close to what's needed already exists, extend or modify it rather than adding a duplicate.
- Unless otherwise specified, approach coding tasks test-first. When strict TDD isn't practical, still write tests alongside each step of implementation rather than batching them at the end.
- Unless a project's CLAUDE.md specifies otherwise, pause between steps or chunks of work for me to review changes and handle git. When pausing, summarize what changed since the last commit.
